# Cryptography-I
**Stanford University** -  Dan Boneh, Professor

**Course Information:** Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption.

**Informações sobre o curso:** A criptografia é uma ferramenta indispensável para proteger a informação em sistemas de computador. Neste curso você aprenderá o funcionamento interno de sistemas criptográficos e como usá-los corretamente em aplicações do mundo real. O curso começa com uma discussão detalhada de como duas partes que têm uma chave secreta compartilhada podem se comunicar de forma segura quando um adversário poderoso espia e manipula o tráfego. Vamos examinar muitos protocolos implantados e analisar erros em sistemas existentes. A segunda metade do curso discute técnicas de chave pública que permitem que duas partes gerem uma chave secreta compartilhada. Ao longo do curso os participantes serão expostos a muitos problemas abertos emocionantes no campo e trabalharão em projetos de programação divertidos (opcionais). Em um segundo curso (Crypto II), cobriremos tarefas criptográficas mais avançadas, como conhecimento zero, mecanismos de privacidade e outras formas de criptografia.

**Course Overview**

Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Participants will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key exchange. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption.

**Homework and Grading**

* There will be a weekly problem set that includes an optional programming component. Participants are expected to solve these assignments on their own, but can discuss clarification questions on the course forum.

* Participants can attempt each of the problem sets three times every 8 hours. After each submission the system will provide explanations about correct and incorrect answers. When participants attempt to solve the problem set again, many of the questions will be different.

* The programming assignments are optional. Participants are free to use any language of their choice to solve the programming assignments. Our sample code will be given in Python although that code is not required to complete these optional assignments.

* A passing grade be given to participants who obtain more than 80% of the maximum score on the problem sets and final exam. The programming assignments are optional.

* In-video quizzes are not graded and are only there to help participants with self assessment.

* Many of the modules contain links to research papers for further readings. These are intended for participants interested in learning more about the material covered. These further readings are optional.

* There will be a final exam (no midterm) that is similar in style to the problem sets, but covers the material of the entire course.
